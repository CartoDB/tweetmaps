312471327 = sum of US population


# firstly, all 52 states have 1
UPDATE state_2010census_dp1 SET num_points = 1

# this leaves 48 remaining points to split between remaining states based on population

# number of points per state
UPDATE state_2010census_dp1 SET num_points = num_points+round(((population::float)/(312471327::float/48::float)))

#
SELECT sum(num_points) from  state_2010census_dp1



# random points for 



# collectors over 10 major cities





# 3 approaches

1. Cities + buffer out
2. Grid 98 cells (1 cell for Hawaii, 1 for Alaska) - get extent of US excluding these and make equal area grid
3. Something fancy with the states


# ok, cities it is...

# Get most populated city in each state and place point on it. (take city out of working set)
# for remaning 48 cities, sort cities by population and place points on them until no points left
# for radius, buffer out by
